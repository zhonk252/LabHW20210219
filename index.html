        never want to talk about it

       <p class='lyrics1'>
       Take me back to November
       Take me back to November
       Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
       Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
       Can we go back to November?
       Take me back to November
       Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
       Naw, take me back to November, 
       
       wassup
       What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
       What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?
       What if I'm hustling backwards?
       What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
       Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
       I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
       Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
       What if my music too weird for the masses?
       And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
       All my day ones turn to three, fours cause of track seven
       Fuck, what if I get stuck?
       What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
       What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
       At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
       Damn, I would be hurtin'
       Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
       Last year in total, I put out two verses
       But five seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect</p>
