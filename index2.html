    Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so whats they ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November was performing with Lil Wayne
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone
Who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014 Miami 43rd Street, everyday was November</p></div>
