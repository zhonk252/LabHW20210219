    <p>Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back
        I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
        Time travel back and help me find
        Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
        Take me back, take me back
        Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
        "My November is right now"
        I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
        I consider my heart rate has slowed down at the ending
        Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it
        If you do answer, I play it to state facts
        Although I already know the response you gon' say back
        At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
        And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback
        Hello, no one is available to take your call
        Please leave a message after the tone</p>
